## Desctitptin :
In this analysis, I will dive into the dataset, which includes the locations of businesses that pay taxes to the city and county of SF. I want to derive insights from this dataset and learn which industries are most popular and have room for potential growth in SF. Which areas are popular for people to have their office? 

## Main Findings : 

+ The highest number of active businesses in San Francisco are in the Financial District area.
+ The less popular and newer industries, such as utilities and insurance, can benefit the most from the government's new tax scheme.
+ The transportation and Warehousing industry is showing an upward trend in growth. 
+ The average business last across all industries is 6 year.
+ Transportation and Warehousing has the shortest business longevity.


## Installing : 
This project is written in Python 3.6 and requires the installation of the following Python libraries:

+ matplotlib 2.0.2
+ NumPy 1.13.3
+ Folium 0l5.0

## Data source :
A dataset with the locations of businesses that pay taxes to the City and County of San Francisco. Each registered business may have multiple locations and each location is a single row. The Treasurer & Tax Collectorâ€™s Office collects this data through business registration applications, account update/closure forms, and taxpayer filings.
